# Home.tsx JSX Syntax Fix

## Issue
Dev server showing 500 error with message:
```
Unexpected token, expected "," (414:12)
> 414 |             }
      |             ^
```

## Root Cause
The error was showing because there was a syntax error where line 414 had a standalone `}` instead of the proper JSX closing `)}`.

## Fix Applied
Changed line 414 from:
```tsx
            }  // ❌ Wrong
```

To:
```tsx
            )}  // ✅ Correct
```

## Current State
The file now has the correct JSX structure:

```tsx
{selectedWorkspace.projects && selectedWorkspace.projects.length > 0 ? (
  <div className={STYLE_CONSTANTS.spacing.section}>
    {/* Projects list */}
  </div>
) : (
  <div className="text-center py-16">
    {/* No projects message */}
  </div>
)}  // ← Line 414: Correctly closes the ternary expression
```

## Solution
The dev server needed to be restarted to pick up the corrected file. The syntax is now valid.

## Verification
✅ File content verified (line 414 shows `)}`)  
✅ JSX structure is valid  
✅ Dev server restarted  
✅ Should reload automatically  

If the error persists, try:
1. Stop the dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear vite cache: `rm -rf node_modules/.vite`
3. Restart: `npm run dev`
