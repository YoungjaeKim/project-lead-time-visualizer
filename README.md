# project-lead-time-visualizer

## Introduction

This project aims to visualize the lead time of projects by integrating data from Confluence, GitHub and Jira. 
The goal is to provide insights into the time taken for various stages of project development, from planning to deployment.

This is my personal project to learn about data visualization, Express backend and Vite frontend development.
