## âœ… Documentation

- [x] `frontend/PARTICIPANT_MODEL_MIGRATION.md` created
- [x] `PARTICIPANT_REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md` created
- [x] `VERIFICATION_CHECKLIST.md` created (this file)

## âœ… Code Quality

- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Proper error handling in controllers
- [x] Validation in place for required fields
- [x] Type safety maintained throughout
- [x] Comments added where needed

## âœ… Backward Compatibility Considerations

- [x] Old participant endpoints removed (breaking change documented)
- [x] Project creation adapted (no longer accepts participants array)
- [x] Cost analysis enhanced (now includes role information)
- [x] All UI components updated to work with new structure

## ðŸ”„ Recommended Testing

### Backend API Tests
- [ ] Test creating participant groups
- [ ] Test adding members with multiple roles
- [ ] Test updating member roles
- [ ] Test removing members
- [ ] Test deleting participant groups
- [ ] Test hierarchical relationships (parent/child)
- [ ] Test cascade deletion (project deletion cleans up participants)
- [ ] Test cost analysis with participant groups
- [ ] Test population queries

### Frontend Integration Tests
- [ ] Test project display with participant groups
- [ ] Test member count calculation
- [ ] Test cost calculation with new structure
- [ ] Test user project filtering
- [ ] Test project creation (without participants)
- [ ] Test empty states (no participants, no members)
- [ ] Test hierarchical display

### Manual Testing Flow
1. [ ] Create a new project
2. [ ] Create participant group for the project
3. [ ] Add members to the group with multiple roles
4. [ ] View project detail page - verify team structure displays correctly
5. [ ] View project list - verify member count is correct
6. [ ] Check cost analysis - verify it includes all members
7. [ ] Filter projects by user - verify filtering works
8. [ ] Update member roles
9. [ ] Remove member from group
10. [ ] Delete participant group
11. [ ] Delete project - verify participant groups are cleaned up

## âœ… Performance Considerations

- [x] Indexes added on Participant model:
  - [x] `projectId`
  - [x] `parentParticipant`
  - [x] `name`
- [x] Efficient population queries
- [x] Cleanup on cascading deletes

## âœ… Security Considerations

- [x] Input validation on all endpoints
- [x] Required field validation
- [x] Array validation for roles
- [x] ObjectId validation
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
